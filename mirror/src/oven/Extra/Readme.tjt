fix_oven.c was how tom was going to do the database byte swapping.
database_fix.c was how database.c was going to interface with this.

Skip had a better idea, namely leaving database.c as it is and
making changes to ipportrw.c, which is the way the code is,
but I couldn't just delete these two files, even though they
are not likely to ever be used.
